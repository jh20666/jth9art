<font color=white>During drawing this we focussed on Value using gradations from 0 to 100, and we used one line.</font></p>
<p><font color=white>When we drew using 1 line we couldn't even pick our hand up.</font></p>
<p><font color=white>Some of the challenges were making sure it didn't jump and the gradation was good and making sure its as smooth as I can get it.</font></p>
<p><font color=white>I think it was a pretty hard drawing, and it was good but could've been better.</font></p> <p><font color=white>It was fun working with a classmate to draw eachother too!</font></p>
