During drawing this we focussed on Value using gradations from 0 to 100, and we used one line. When we drew using 1 line we couldn't even pick our hand up. Some of the challenges were making sure it didn't jump and the gradation was good and making sure its as smooth as I can get it. I think it was a pretty hard drawing, and it was good but could've been better. It was fun working with a classmate to draw eachother too!
